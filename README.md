# Identify-Malicious-Internet-Users-Using-Tor

I wrote this tool as part of my final year dissertation in order to identify malicious internet users using Tor. The tool is designed to be placed on a honeypot that can be easily broken into. It is disguised as a file crypter in order to social engineer malicious internet users into thinking it can be used to make their Remote Administration Tools (RATS) undetected by popular Antivirus products. The tool is simply a proof of concept and demonstrates how even the tech savvy are susceptible to social engineering.
